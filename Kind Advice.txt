---------------------------------------------Question 2 [IMPORTANT]-----------------------------------------------------
2-1 In the existing dinning/cater Apps, they cannot list supplier info in their apps without permission,is it correct
2-2 If so, is it because of the copyright in Singapore ? How about in China or other country
2-3 If we cannot list supplier info fully in a row, will that be a huge challenging to us?

Please kindly refer to the App 'Burpple'
