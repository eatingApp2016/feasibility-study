//1 AND 4 yet to be finished by Du Hong coz need more research about them
2 Similar apps in Singapore 
hungry go where: biggest food guide platform among Singapore. Has similar function base on real-time locating and search,review,discount
burpple        : similar functions like our design. Seems user not active and the platform did not provide much restautant info.
chope          : restaurant reservations

Conclusion: There are similar apps in the market now. But when I went through them, there are not many users within these platforms.
We need to specify more about products and our marketing

3 Which factors maybe make us succeed

Product
- We aim at collecting and providing huge dinning/catering info within legal scope
- Simple UI with useful functions. We will do avoid showy design (Design can refer to SG Bus or IOS style)
- Other interesting functions
eg. AA share, after a table lunch, how much I will need to pay back to the payer
    Everyday draw, to get $1
    Food recommand according to habit


Team
- Team with good communication skills and programming skill(low expense and cost in tech)

Strategy
- We won't target so called 'general group', instead, will focus on certain group of people first.
eg. White-collars who always go to lunch near office side/Guys from China who prefer to have China's food/People who are managing to keep fit

- Use as gaming
eg. Collecting points and draw for 'Iphone'

- Dummuy data. 
At the very beginning of the production release, we can create many user accounts and create dummy info





---------------------------------------------Question 2 [IMPORTANT]-----------------------------------------------------
2-1 In the existing dinning/cater Apps, they cannot list supplier info in their apps without permission,is it correct
2-2 If so, is it because of the copyright in Singapore ? How about in China or other country
2-3 If we cannot list supplier info fully in a row, will that be a huge challenging to us?

Please kindly refer to the App 'Burpple'

Success
full functions : provide more informations about the restaurants 

user friendly app : try to use some "foodie" app which is not convenient to use (UI/UX desgin must be attrative)

use as gaming : people who use this app to collect point which user is not just use but also can benefit from it 

different from other apps : 
 
- provide super convenient,faster way for user to get their favor restaurants
- connect suppliers(fruits/veg/ingredients/accesorries) with the owner  
- combine all the features function of others app to become a ONE-STOP apps

Problems 
1. how to let user automatically provide their own information accurately to build our DB
2. promote the apps (so many similar foodie apps)
3. co-operate with others existing apps 

Functions
1. search by diff criteria: Location/Price range/Type of Food/Calories/
Advance function *Comments from customers/Status of foodpt/Booking Service/Discount or voucher plan

2. apps can detect the user`s location and show the appropriate nearest foodpt(cafe/restaurant/hawker/fastfood)
OR  user can manually key in the location(browse usage)

3. user can search by ONE or MULTIPLE condition, if no record found or match then the similar or nearest shop will show up

4. when user select the restaurant, apps will provide map function(avoid user to search again on maps to please user experience)

5. for owner to update their info(eg.menu updated/holidays information/discount/promotion etc...)

6. well categorize the type of restaurant(eg.halal/vege etc. OR gathering/dating/celebration/annual dinner/stomach needs/high tea/tourists/buffet etc..)

7. shopping cart(user can store their favor restaurants in cart)

8. link with social apps(eg.whatapps/wechat/line)? User can add others(friends list)
- X user can select some restaurant for Y user to choose/ select then send 
- select some restaurants to recommended their friends 

@ ADVANCE(use data mining,big data to analyse)
data record the user experience
   (eg.track the user favourite - as user will upload photo and comments to gain points
				- new restaurant/doing promotion restaurants will prompt the user to go)

@ for those user can not make decision
Gaming(Roulette): user can select few(min:2/max:10 or more) restaurants , Apps will auto select for you 

Compare functions : user can select few(maybe around 3) restaurants ,the info will list out and doing compare by(distance km/hr,price$/$$/$$$,etc...)
